# Dangerous Adventures
## Description
A game about treasure, adventure, mischief and love! Until your friends mess you up and take all of your items D: 
You and at least one friend control adventurers, player pieces with an inventory and a desire to get rich. You move around the dungeon, exploring it, opening chests and dodging traps. The objective of the game is to be the first player to escape the various dungeons after unlocking the exit with a number of artifacts. You and your fellow adventurers may cooperate, but you must compete as well for there can be only one winner who gets all the fame and glory.

Meanwhile overlooking the board is an evil Dungeon Master, who controls monsters, places traps and whose sole purpose is to make your adventure miserable and kill all of the adventurers, depleting their lives so the Dungeon Master may win. With a selection of various items for the adventurers, as well as a large catalogue of monsters, races and traps for the Dungeon Master there are endless strategies and possibilities to how games will play out. When playing with friends just make sure they're very good friends or ones that you don't mind losing over a board game match.
