For some basic formatting run CodeFormatter.

Other rules:

1. 	public variables are written before/above private variables
2. 	always use braces
3. 	use foreach instead of for loops when possible
4. 	use print instead of Debug.Log when possible
5. 	use var for simple/obvious types (like int and bool) or for very large types
6. 	don't do this -> if (something) print("Hello World"); 
7. 	enumeration value start with a Capital letter.
8. 	functions and classes use PascalCase
9. 	always write private when something is not public
10.	private variables beging with an underscore -> _privateVariable
